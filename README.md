## 📊 Data Sources

The application integrates with three Google Sheets:

### 1. Teams & Budget Sheet
- Team names and identifiers
- Initial budget allocations
- Current remaining funds
- Total players count
- Foreign players count
- Total team points

### 2. Players Catalogue
- Complete player database

### 3. Auctioneer Sheet
- Live auction results
- Final bid amounts
- Player status (sold/unsold)
- Real-time updates during auction

**Note**: The application expects 400 errors during sheet fetching as it tries multiple sheet identifiers to find the correct data source. This is normal behavior.

## 🛠️ Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server on port 5000 with hot reload
npm run check        # Run TypeScript type checking

# Production
npm run build        # Build frontend + backend for production
npm run start        # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run check        # Full TypeScript type checking
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:5000` (or `0.0.0.0:5000` on Replit)

2. **Make your changes**
   - Hot module replacement (HMR) enabled
   - Changes reflect immediately in browser
   - TypeScript errors shown in terminal

3. **Run type checking**

```bash
npm run check
```

4. **Test with real data**
   - Update Google Sheets URLs in `googleSheetsService.ts`
   - Data refreshes every 60 seconds automatically
   - Check browser console for fetch logs

5. **Build for production**

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates optimized build in `dist/` directory

### Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript** - Strict mode with comprehensive type safety
- **Component Structure** - React functional components with hooks
- **Styling** - Tailwind CSS utility classes with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management** - TanStack Query for server state, useState for local state
- **Data Fetching** - Direct Google Sheets integration via frontend services
- **File Organization** - Feature-based organization with shared components

### Adding New Features

#### Add a New Team Logo

1. Place logo image in `client/src/assets/teamLogos/`
2. Update `teamLogos` object in `LeaderboardView.tsx`:

```typescript
const teamLogos: Record<string, string> = {
  "Team Name": "/teamLogos/team-logo.png",
  // ... other teams
};
```

#### Add a New Data Column

1. Update data types in `shared/schema.ts`
2. Modify Google Sheets service parsing in `googleSheetsService.ts`
3. Add column to relevant component (LeaderboardView, PlayerCard, etc.)
4. Update sorting logic if sortable

#### Customize Theme Colors

Edit `client/src/index.css`:

```css
:root {
  --background: hsl(222, 47%, 11%);
  --primary: hsl(20, 100%, 50%);
  /* ... customize other colors */
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Google Sheets 400 Errors (EXPECTED BEHAVIOR)

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400
```

**This is normal!** The service tries multiple sheet identifiers (GIDs) to find the correct data. These 400 errors are expected and don't affect functionality.

**Verify it's working**:
- Check for "Successfully parsed X rows" logs
- Data should load after a few 400 errors
- Teams and players should display correctly

#### 2. Data Not Refreshing

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for fetch errors
- Verify Google Sheets are publicly accessible
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check network tab for CSV request status
- Ensure sheet permissions allow public CSV export

#### 3. Circular Ranks Not Displaying

**Solution**:
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check that `rounded-full` class is present in LeaderboardView.tsx
- Verify Tailwind CSS is compiling correctly

#### 4. Foreign Players Column Missing

**Solution**:
- Ensure Google Sheets "Teams & Budget" has "Foreign Players" column
- Check that data parsing includes `overseasCount` field
- Verify column is added to LeaderboardView component

#### 5. Port Already in Use (Replit)

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5000
```

**Solution**:
- Stop existing workflow in Replit
- Click "Stop" button then "Run" again
- Port 5000 is required for Replit's proxy

#### 6. Vite Not Connecting

**Solution (Replit)**:
- Verify `allowedHosts: true` in `vite.config.ts`
- Check server is bound to `0.0.0.0:5000`
- Restart the workflow
- Clear browser cache

### Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: 60-second client-side cache reduces API calls
- **Bundle Splitting**: Automatic code splitting via Vite
- **Image Optimization**: Optimized team logos and assets
- **Sheet Structure**: Keep sheets clean with proper headers
- **Query Optimization**: TanStack Query prevents redundant fetches
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on-demand for faster initial render

## 🔧 Configuration

### Google Sheets Setup

#### Required Sheet Structure

4. Extract spreadsheet ID from URL
5. Update in `googleSheetsService.ts`

### Environment Variables
